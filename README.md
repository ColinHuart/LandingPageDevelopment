# LandingPageDevelopment
During the Digital Sprint formation at the Becode, we were asked to design a site about one of our passion, based on a given design template
I obviously choose bird.
The site had to : -be responsive (320px and more) and create in mobile phone mode first
                  -have a good use of semantic
                  -have at least 1 use of JS
                  -contain some elements such as a burger menu or a carousel
At the end, the responsivity was the hardest part for me. The site is ok within the range of 320px and on my full screen but become messy bewteen this numbers
